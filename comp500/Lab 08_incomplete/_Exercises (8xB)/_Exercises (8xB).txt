8x05b - Rectangle and Point
	Write and test a program with the following features.

	Firstly, declare an enumerated type named Result, which has two following possible values, OUTSIDE and INSIDE.

	Next, define a new structure type named Point, representing coordinates with floats for the x and y values.

	Also, define a new structured type named Rectangle, which has sides parallel to the x-axis and y-axis, allowing you to represent the rectangle with the bottom_left and top_right points.

	Next write a function that computes and returns the area of a Rectangle, based upon the Rectangle parameter passed into the function. Use pass by value behaviour. Ensure the function returns the appropriate type of data!

	Next write a function that tests whether a Point is inside a Rectangle. This function should take in two parameters by value, the Point and the Rectangle to test. The function must return a Result enumerated type value of INSIDE if the point is inside the rectangle, otherwise it must return the value OUTSIDE.

	Write a main function, with appropriate local variables as test data to then use on the two functions above.

8x09b - Pascals Adventure
Pascal created an Adventure-style game. The source code has only one function, the main. The program would benefit greatly from the creation of functions to help modularise the overall program. Also, an enumeration could be used to create a type of the player’s class, rather than using a char.

Test the current implementation of Pascal’s Adventure, then once you understand its behaviour, modularise the program by creating functions. Also create an enumerated type for the player class, and replace the existing char variable that stores the player’s class.

Ensure the whitespace of your source code is well formatted and all functions, and variables, are well named.

Pascal’s Adventure source code:

	#include <stdio.h>

	int main(void)
	{
		char name[21];
		int gold = 0;
		
		printf("Welcome to Pascal's Adventure Game!\n");

8x10b - Tic-Tac-Toe
	Design and implement a game of Tic-Tac-Toe, where two players take turns placing pieces into a 3 by 3 board with the winning goal of achieving three of their pieces in a row, horizontally, vertically or diagonally.

	An example of the program output is as follows:

	   |   |
	 1 | 2 | 3
	   |   |
	---+---+---
	   |   |
	 4 | 5 | 6
	   |   |
	---+---+---
	   |   |
	 7 | 8 | 9
	   |   |
	   
	x's turn:

	   |   |
	 o | o | x
	   |   |
	---+---+---
	   |   |
	 4 | x | 6
	   |   |
	---+---+---
	   |   |
	 o | x | 9
	   |   |
	   
	x's turn: 4
