Just about every device or system we use or interact with is managed, facilitated or controlled by computers. Careers in computer and information sciences span many industries. You might work for a hospital supporting high-tech medical equipment, work alongside engineers modelling bridges and tall buildings or provide IT solutions to corporate clients through your own company. You can also continue into postgraduate study and conduct cutting-edge research, including processing data and helping find answers for the Square Kilometre Array – a project which will build our understanding of the universe and drive technological development worldwide.
