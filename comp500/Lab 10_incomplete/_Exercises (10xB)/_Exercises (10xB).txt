10x03b - main Repeater
Write a program that processes the arguments passed into main from the command line.

The first argument is expected to be a number. The second argument is expected to be a single word.

The program must then print the single word argument, the number of times specified by the first argument, each time separated by a comma.

For example, if the program was run as follows:
exercise.exe 5 hello

	hello,hello,hello,hello,hello

For example, if the program was run as follows:
exercise.exe 7 CAT

	CAT,CAT,CAT,CAT,CAT,CAT,CAT

If the program is run with --help used as an argument, for example:
exercise.exe --help
	This program repeats a word a specified number of times.
	
	To use the program:
	
	exercise.exe n word
	
	Where n is the number of times to repeat the text 'word'

Implement a structure type named Prime_Minister. Use appropriate data types and names for the structure’s members. In main instantiate nine structure variables, one for each Prime Minister listed in the table above. Set the members of each structure appropriately.

Next, create a function named print_prime_minister, which can be passed a single struct Prime_Minister variable by reference. Declare a prototype for this function. Use function recursion to print out a Prime Ministers’ successors. For example, when the Helen Clark structure variable reference is passed to the print_prime_minister function the following output must be generated, noting that the successor is the person who held the office immediately after them.

	Prime Minister: Helen Clark
	Term began: 1999
	Term ended: 2008
	Helen Clark's successor was...
	Prime Minister: John Key
	Term began: 2008
	Term ended: 2016
	John Key's successor was...
	Prime Minister: Bill English
	Term began: 2016
	Term ended: 2017
	Bill English's successor was...
	Prime Minister: Jacinda Ardern
	Term began: 2017
